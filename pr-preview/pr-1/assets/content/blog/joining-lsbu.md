After a hectic September devoted to childcare, project preparation, administrative duties, and moving logistics, I have successfully made the transition to London South Bank University - and secured an office with a view!

## A Warm Welcome

I have been overwhelmed by the warm welcome I've received from colleagues throughout the institution. From the moment I arrived, everyone has been incredibly helpful and supportive, making the transition much smoother than I could have hoped.

## First Impressions

Several things have particularly impressed me about LSBU:

### Convenient Location

The location is excellent - right in the heart of London, easily accessible from Waterloo station. I've been enjoying the commute via bike-sharing, which is a pleasant way to start and end the workday.

### Engaged Students

The students I've met so far have been enthusiastic and engaged. I'm looking forward to teaching and mentoring them as they develop their skills in engineering and materials science.

### Research Opportunities

Perhaps most exciting are the abundant research partnership possibilities within the School of Engineering. There are excellent opportunities for collaboration with colleagues working on complementary topics, and I'm eager to develop new research directions and projects.

## Looking Forward

I'm thrilled to be establishing the **SLIMES Lab** (South London Innovative Materials Evaluation Squad) here at LSBU. This will be a hub for computational materials science research, with a focus on:

- Quantum computing applications for materials science
- Energy materials (batteries, fuel cells, thermoelectrics)
- Defect physics in functional materials
- Integration of machine learning with traditional computational methods

## Building the Team

I'm now looking to recruit talented PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to join the group. If you're interested in computational materials science and want to work on cutting-edge research problems, please get in touch!

The combination of LSBU's strong engineering tradition, central London location, and commitment to research excellence makes this an exciting place to build a research program. I'm looking forward to the years ahead!
