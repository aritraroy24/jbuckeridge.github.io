# Occult Chemistry

I have recently been reading Philip Ball's book *Invisible*, which discusses the connections between science and the occult in the 19th century. During this period, many new discoveries were being made about phenomena that could not be directly observed - radio waves, x-rays, and cathode rays (electrons) were all "invisible" to the naked eye. These discoveries naturally led to speculation about other invisible phenomena, including those associated with the paranormal.

## Sir William Crookes and the Radiometer

One fascinating example discussed in the book is Sir William Crookes, the inventor of the radiometer. Crookes apparently believed that his device could be used to measure psychic forces. The radiometer, which spins when exposed to light due to temperature differences, was initially thought to demonstrate radiation pressure, but the explanation turned out to be more subtle.

## Occult Chemistry: Atomic Diagrams from Imagination

Perhaps most remarkable is the book *Occult Chemistry* by Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater, two theosophists who claimed to be able to observe atoms through clairvoyant vision. They produced detailed drawings of atomic structures based entirely on their imagination rather than any empirical evidence. 

Astonishingly, some of these imagined structures bear a striking resemblance to modern depictions of atomic orbitals! This is likely coincidence rather than genuine insight, but it highlights how even wild speculation can occasionally stumble upon patterns that resemble reality.

## Science Within Social Context

This historical episode reminds us that scientific investigation always occurs within a sociological context. While the scientific method is designed to eliminate bias and ensure objectivity, the implementation of this method is carried out by humans who are inevitably influenced by the culture and beliefs of their time.

Despite our best efforts, we cannot completely separate ourselves from these influences. The key is to remain aware of them and continually question our assumptions.

## Contemporary Parallels

It makes me wonder: which of our current scientific pursuits will seem equally peculiar to future generations? Perhaps interpretations like the many-worlds hypothesis, or our theories about dark energy and dark matter, will one day be viewed with the same mixture of fascination and skepticism that we now apply to 19th-century occult chemistry.

## Conclusion

Science aspires toward rationality and objectivity, but it remains fundamentally a human endeavor, shaped by the biases, limitations, and cultural frameworks within which discoveries occur. Understanding this history helps us maintain appropriate humility about our current understanding while still appreciating the remarkable progress that the scientific method has enabled.
