# Special Issue in Crystals

**Date:** Thursday, October 24, 2019  
**Author:** John Buckeridge

I am pleased to announce that I am serving as guest editor for a special issue in the journal *Crystals* focused on **semiconductor defects**.

## About the Special Issue

This is a relatively broad topic that I hope will attract a diverse set of papers from researchers working in this area. Semiconductor defects are crucial to understanding and controlling the properties of these materials, which form the foundation of modern electronics and optoelectronics.

## Scope

The special issue welcomes submissions on all aspects of defects in semiconductors, including:

- Point defects (vacancies, interstitials, substitutional impurities)
- Extended defects (dislocations, grain boundaries, stacking faults)
- Defect complexes and clusters
- Theoretical and computational studies of defect properties
- Experimental characterization of defects
- The role of defects in device performance
- Defect engineering for improved materials properties

## Why Submit?

If you have relevant work in this area, your contributions will be in good company and should reach the correct audience. The journal *Crystals* is a well-established open-access publication with good visibility in the materials science community.

## More Information

For additional details about the special issue, submission guidelines, and deadlines, please visit the journal's official special issue webpage.

I look forward to receiving your submissions and working with the community to produce a high-quality collection of papers on this important topic!
