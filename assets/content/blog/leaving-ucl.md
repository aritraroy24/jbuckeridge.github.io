Today marks the end of an era - my last day at University College London's Department of Chemistry after more than eight wonderful years. While I'm excited about my new position at London South Bank University, leaving UCL is bittersweet.

## A Journey of Discovery and Friendship

During my time at UCL, I have:

- Made many friends who I will miss dearly
- Been involved in a lot of great research projects that have advanced our understanding of materials
- Formed professional collaborations that will hopefully continue despite the change of institution
- Learned and grown as a researcher and mentor

## Two Research Groups

I was fortunate to work with two excellent research groups during my tenure:

### Richard's Group (2011-2018)

I spent many productive years in Richard Catlow's group, working on computational materials chemistry. The collaborative atmosphere and intellectual stimulation were exceptional.

### David's Group (2018-2019)

More recently, I worked with David Scanlon's group, continuing research on defects in semiconductors and functional materials. David's enthusiasm and insight have been inspiring.

## Farewell Celebrations

My colleagues have been incredibly generous with farewell celebrations:

- Multiple meals at local restaurants (including a memorable evening at the local Greek restaurant)
- Gatherings at the Housman Room
- Social events at nearby pubs
- Countless conversations over coffee and lunch

These moments remind me that while research papers and grants are important, it's the people and relationships that make a place special.

## What I'll Miss

There are many things about UCL I'll miss:

- **Lunch Punch in the gym** - a great way to stay fit and socialize
- The vibrant seminar series bringing in speakers from around the world
- Spontaneous scientific discussions in corridors and offices
- The intellectual atmosphere of one of the world's leading research universities
- The beautiful UCL campus and surrounding Bloomsbury area

## Gratitude

I am deeply grateful to:

- **Richard Catlow** for bringing me to UCL and providing mentorship and opportunities
- **David Scanlon** for the collaboration and friendship
- **All my colleagues** in the Department of Chemistry who have made these years so rewarding
- **The students and postdocs** I've worked with - you've taught me as much as I've taught you
- **The technical and administrative staff** who keep everything running smoothly

## Staying Connected

Although I'm moving to a new institution, I hope to maintain the friendships and collaborations I've built at UCL. The department will always hold a special place in my career and my heart.

Thank you, UCL, for eight amazing years. Here's to the next chapter!
