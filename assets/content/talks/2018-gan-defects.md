# The Defect Physics of GaN

## How the Competition Between Compact and Shallow States Determines Luminescence Properties

### Introduction

Gallium nitride (GaN) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with remarkable optical and electronic properties, making it essential for LEDs, lasers, and high-power electronics. Understanding its luminescence characteristics requires a deep knowledge of the defect physics governing electron localization.

### Compact vs. Shallow States

Point defects in GaN can host electrons in two distinct types of states:

**Compact States**
- Strongly localized around the defect core
- Deep energy levels within the bandgap
- Significant lattice relaxation
- Often responsible for non-radiative recombination

**Shallow States**
- Weakly bound, hydrogenic-like states
- Energy levels close to band edges
- Minimal lattice distortion
- Can contribute to radiative processes

### Luminescence Mechanisms

The competition between these state types determines whether a defect acts as:

1. **Efficient luminescence center** - facilitating radiative recombination
2. **Non-radiative trap** - dissipating energy through phonons
3. **Compensation center** - affecting carrier concentration without optical activity

### Computational Insights

Using density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals, we can:

- Accurately predict defect formation energies
- Determine charge transition levels
- Calculate configuration coordinate diagrams
- Assess radiative vs. non-radiative recombination rates

### Key Findings

Our calculations reveal that the balance between compact and shallow states in GaN is highly sensitive to:

- Local chemical environment
- Fermi level position
- Temperature and pressure conditions
- Strain state of the material

### Implications for Device Design

Understanding this competition enables:

- Optimization of growth conditions to minimize non-radiative centers
- Engineering of intentional defects for specific optical properties
- Prediction of device degradation mechanisms
- Design of more efficient light-emitting devices
